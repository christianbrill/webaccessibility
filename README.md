# Web Accessibility & Web Inclusion

<p>If you've ever had to change the contrast on your TV because you had trouble seeing certain things, or you've zoomed in on parts of a website because they were too hard to read, then you know why it's important to create websites so we all can use them equally.</p>
<p>Inclusion of people with disabilities is essential because they make up around 20% of internauts. "Disability" doesn't only mean someone who's in a wheelchair or someone who's lost their eyesight. If you're colorblind, for example, you can already be at a disadvantage online because all too often, websites use colors as navigational aids only.</p>
<p>Thus, this repository will deal with some of the most important factors when it comes to web accessibility. I will include examples of how to code a website disability-friendly and will provide you with tips and tricks on how to generally make your websites as inclusive and accessible as you can. Please, feel free to use any of the code and tips and make them your own. My goal is to create a digital world in which we all can use the Internet with fewer to no obstacles.</p>
